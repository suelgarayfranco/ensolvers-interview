# Ensolvers Interview (Tasks Manager)

## Introduction
For this fullstack implementation I used ReactJS to build the frontend, and Java Sring Boot for the REST API in the backend. For data persistance I used MySQL.

### Tools Versions
* Java: 17.0.1 
* MySQL: 8.0
* Spring Boot: 2.5.6
* React: 17.0.2
* Node: 14.18.1
* npm: 6.14.15

## Run the application
Once the repository is cloned onto the local computer (and all tools are installed):
1. Start the MySQL server and create a DB schema called "db_tasks_manager" with user "root" and password "1234"
2. Open the folder "tasks-manager-backend" from an IDE (e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ) and run the TasksManagerBackendApplication class.
3. Run the frontend server from the command line: cd into the folder "tasks-manager-ui" and execute the command *npm start*
